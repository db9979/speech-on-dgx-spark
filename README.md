# Speech on DGX Spark

**English** | [Deutsch](README.de.md) · Idea: Dominik Bornhäußer

[![Buy me a coffee](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20me%20a%20coffee-support-FFDD00?logo=buymeacoffee&logoColor=black)](https://buymeacoffee.com/zquu1xu570)

Speech recognition (**Qwen3-ASR**) and text to speech (**Qwen3-TTS**) as services on an NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10), plus a web panel with a voice assistant, profiles and monitoring. Runs natively with systemd, without Docker, next to [dgx-spark-qwen38](https://github.com/hasso5703/dgx-spark-qwen38), which provides the language model.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/db9979/speech-on-dgx-spark
cd speech-on-dgx-spark
sudo ./install.sh
```

The script asks what to install:

- **Complete**: models, APIs and the web panel with the assistant.
- **Only the models with their APIs**: for Open WebUI, your own apps or Home Assistant, without the panel. Managed with `sudo speech-spark`.

At the end it prints the address, password and API key, then TTS speaks a sentence and ASR checks it. The panel is at `https://SPARK:31443` (https is needed so the browser allows the microphone).

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Update | button in the panel under *Settings → Update and backup*, or `sudo speech-spark update` |
| Show addresses and keys | `sudo speech-spark info` |
| Uninstall | `sudo ./uninstall.sh` (config, models and voices stay; `--purge` removes everything) |

All options for running without questions (`--mode api --asr 1.7b --tts 0.6b --yes` …) are in [Installation in detail](docs/en/installation.md).

## Latest changes

<!-- New version: add one line at the top here and in CHANGELOG.md, drop the oldest line here (keep 10). Details go to docs/de and docs/en, not into this README. -->

- **V01.0.347** Spark companion in the Spark look (face as icon, windows like the panel, light and dark), shows new versions and updates itself after a click (the Spark fetches and checks them), link "☕ Support Spark"
- **V01.0.346** reMarkable @Spark: question from handwriting without the reader's "Bild:" line and [unleserlich], the model also answers from its own knowledge instead of just "no answer", diagnosis line "remarkable: @Spark answer …"
- **V01.0.344** More with the reMarkable (admin sub-switch + one per function under Me → reMarkable, all off): morning sheet as PDF with note lines, "@Spark" questions on paper get an answer next to them, tasks from handwriting (reminder only after a click), meeting summaries, week in review on Fridays, web pages and mail attachments to the reMarkable, one inbox per day, a Spark guide to the reMarkable functions and the service that keeps itself up to date
- **V01.0.343** Better Spark help: the switch spots help questions by fixed rules, the help knows every page and frequent questions, a "?" at every switch, and it notes where a question came from (speaker, app, Telegram)
- **V01.0.342** Spark companion on PC and Mac (off): taskbar and menu-bar program with writing help, Ask Spark, dictation, notes, state and kill-switch button, each with its own hotkey; set per device in the panel
- **V01.0.341** Me → Von selbst: switches and buttons of the smart home rules line up again (computer and phone)
- **V01.0.340** Classification with probabilities (off): qwen38 /v1/systemone for tool choice (from 80 %), inbox tidying (from 90 %), important mail by sender and subject and a second opinion in the quality test
- **V01.0.339** Writing help in other programs (off): Mac quick action, Windows program (x64 and ARM, Ctrl+Alt+S), add-in for Outlook, Word and Excel, browser extension and iPhone share, each paired with its own key
- **V01.0.338** Kill switch for admins only; plus "my kill switch" for every profile (Me → Security): stops only that profile, ways in closed and no actions, reading stays; lifted with the PIN
- **V01.0.337** Live overview: the Spark's warnings (slower answers, quality test, memory …) show at their place in the picture

All versions: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

1. You speak into your phone, browser, one of the apps or a speaker. The panel signs you in, sends the audio to **speech recognition** and gets text back.
2. The **router** picks by fixed rules which tools the question needs. The panel passes the text, with memory, conversation history, your own knowledge and exactly those tools, to the **language model** from qwen38.
3. When the answer needs calendars, mail, weather, Home Assistant, web search, Kiwix or Wikipedia, the panel fetches the data itself; switching and adding entries only happen after you confirm.
4. The answer goes sentence by sentence to **text to speech** and is played as a stream while the model is still writing. Priority makes sure spoken answers and important people go first.
5. Other apps use ASR and TTS directly through the OpenAI-style APIs with an API key, MCP programs use the Spark as an MCP server with their own access.

Every feature can be switched on per profile and is off by default. Updates only go live after a green self-test and can be rolled back.
