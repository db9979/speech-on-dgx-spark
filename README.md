# Speech on DGX Spark

**English** | [Deutsch](README.de.md) · Idea: Dominik Bornhäußer

[![Buy me a coffee](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20me%20a%20coffee-support-FFDD00?logo=buymeacoffee&logoColor=black)](https://buymeacoffee.com/zquu1xu570)

Speech recognition (**Qwen3-ASR**) and text to speech (**Qwen3-TTS**) as services on an NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10), plus a web panel with a voice assistant, profiles and monitoring. Runs natively with systemd, without Docker, next to [dgx-spark-qwen38](https://github.com/hasso5703/dgx-spark-qwen38), which provides the language model.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/db9979/speech-on-dgx-spark
cd speech-on-dgx-spark
sudo ./install.sh
```

The script asks what to install:

- **Complete**: models, APIs and the web panel with the assistant.
- **Only the models with their APIs**: for Open WebUI, your own apps or Home Assistant, without the panel. Managed with `sudo speech-spark`.

At the end it prints the address, password and API key, then TTS speaks a sentence and ASR checks it. The panel is at `https://SPARK:31443` (https is needed so the browser allows the microphone).

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Update | button in the panel under *Settings → Update and backup*, or `sudo speech-spark update` |
| Show addresses and keys | `sudo speech-spark info` |
| Uninstall | `sudo ./uninstall.sh` (config, models and voices stay; `--purge` removes everything) |

All options for running without questions (`--mode api --asr 1.7b --tts 0.6b --yes` …) are in [Installation in detail](docs/en/installation.md).

## Latest changes

<!-- New version: add one line at the top here and in CHANGELOG.md, drop the oldest line here (keep 10). Details go to docs/de and docs/en, not into this README. -->

- **V01.0.570** Calm apps: the iPhone shows "not reachable" only after 3 seconds, appends new messages, open pages stay open; Android 1.3.2 waits while the Spark restarts instead of jumping to the address screen
- **V01.0.569** Status → Monitoring as tiles: "Now" and "Today" with icon, large number and colour, every Today tile jumps to its place, the other cards as "Areas"; iPhone with a "Today" section
- **V01.0.568** Chats with other Sparks V2: photos, files and voice messages go too (the receiver checks them and makes them anew), and groups can take in people on other Sparks (text only for now); two new admin switches, both off
- **V01.0.567** Painting pictures with FLUX.2 klein on the Spark: optional at install (--bild), Me → Pictures and in the conversation, fixed rules, image check, every picture marked as AI-made
- **V01.0.566** GitHub token row folds once the token works
- **V01.0.565** RED FIX mail style 2: the browser test waits for the page to start
- **V01.0.564** RED FIX mail style: the browser test switches the feature on for real
- **V01.0.563** Learn mail style: mail drafts by voice and in the Begleiter sound like you, learned from your sent mails (read-only, no mail kept)
- **V01.0.562** Tests green again: the jump link test and the Features page height budget follow the immediate Status poll and the new "Verbrauchszähler" line
- **V01.0.561** Live: boxes under "Services and targets" keep their text in the normal view too

All versions: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

1. You speak into your phone, browser, one of the apps or a speaker. The panel signs you in, sends the audio to **speech recognition** and gets text back.
2. The **router** picks by fixed rules which tools the question needs. The panel passes the text, with memory, conversation history, your own knowledge and exactly those tools, to the **language model** from qwen38.
3. When the answer needs calendars, mail, weather, Home Assistant, web search, Kiwix or Wikipedia, the panel fetches the data itself; switching and adding entries only happen after you confirm.
4. The answer goes sentence by sentence to **text to speech** and is played as a stream while the model is still writing. Priority makes sure spoken answers and important people go first.
5. Other apps use ASR and TTS directly through the OpenAI-style APIs with an API key, MCP programs use the Spark as an MCP server with their own access.

Every feature can be switched on per profile and is off by default. Updates only go live after a green self-test and can be rolled back.
