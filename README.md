# Speech on DGX Spark

**English** | [Deutsch](README.de.md) · Idea: Dominik Bornhäußer

[![Buy me a coffee](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20me%20a%20coffee-support-FFDD00?logo=buymeacoffee&logoColor=black)](https://buymeacoffee.com/zquu1xu570)

Speech recognition (**Qwen3-ASR**), text to speech (**Qwen3-TTS**), pictures (**FLUX.2 klein**) and an own language model (**vLLM**) as services on an NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10), plus a web panel with a voice assistant, profiles and monitoring. Runs natively with systemd, without Docker. The panel runs on the Spark itself or on a small computer of its own such as a Raspberry Pi 5. Instead of the own language model, [dgx-spark-qwen38](https://github.com/hasso5703/dgx-spark-qwen38) can still provide it.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/db9979/speech-on-dgx-spark
cd speech-on-dgx-spark
sudo ./install.sh
```

The script asks what to install:

- **Complete**: models, APIs and the web panel with the assistant.
- **Only the models with their APIs**: for Open WebUI, your own apps or Home Assistant, without the panel. Managed with `sudo speech-spark`.
- **Split** (Spark split): the panel on a computer of its own such as a Raspberry Pi 5, the DGX only serves the models. Guide, also for moving: [Spark split](docs/en/spark-split.md).

At the end it prints the address, password and API key, then TTS speaks a sentence and ASR checks it. The panel is at `https://SPARK:31443` (https is needed so the browser allows the microphone).

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Update | button in the panel under *Settings → Update and backup*, or `sudo speech-spark update` |
| Show addresses and keys | `sudo speech-spark info` |
| Own language model | `sudo ./install.sh --llm`, then `sudo speech-spark modelle llm uebernehmen` (back: `… zurueck`) |
| Workshop (test run, code measurement, diagnosis, repair) | on the model computer `sudo ./install.sh --werkstatt`, then *Features → Workshop* |
| Move the panel to another computer | `sudo speech-spark umziehen --code`, see [Spark split](docs/en/spark-split.md) |
| Uninstall | `sudo ./uninstall.sh` (config, models and voices stay; `--purge` removes everything) |

All options for running without questions (`--mode api --asr 1.7b --tts 0.6b --yes` …) are in [Installation in detail](docs/en/installation.md).

## Latest changes

<!-- New version: add one line at the top here and in CHANGELOG.md, drop the oldest line here (keep 10). Details go to docs/de and docs/en, not into this README. -->

- **V01.0.900** Everything open in the assistant (stages 3 and 4): chat messages, shared things, important mails, questions of running jobs, MCP approvals and, for admins, services that are down as cards under Open (never with text); "Done"/"Later" under Telegram notes and "Done" in the companion with the same checks; "What is open?" by voice (read only); Live per kind; iPhone
- **V01.0.899** Fix self-tests: the invitation test left a Spark calendar and switches turned off behind, later calendar page tests went red; every test class now puts everything back
- **V01.0.898** Kiwix as knowledge: own time limit in the quick look of “Look locally first” (default 900 ms), per question the fitting books (German Wikipedia plus the specialist books whose title fits the question), archive article as a dated source under the answer, order books by dragging, “Check Kiwix” names books the Kiwix no longer knows; a book older than a year gets its date said in the answer
- **V01.0.897** Contacts like Apple Contacts (stage 3b): the Spark as a CardDAV server, the address book "On the Spark" shows in the iPhone's Contacts app (switch "Contacts for contacts apps", off); invitations from mail: an .ics invitation into the calendar with one tap, Accept, Maybe, Decline to the organiser (switch "Invitations from mail", off), panel and iPhone; the contact card with line symbols, "Message" on a PC copies the number
- **V01.0.896** Workshop counts honestly: page tests without a browser show as "did not run" instead of red or green; fix `speech-spark info` without an IP
- **V01.0.895** Fix iPhone app: the knowledge map computes the points' places in Double (cos and sin were ambiguous, the app did not build since V01.0.894)
- **V01.0.894** Knowledge map (stage 1): the knowledge book gets its own menu entry with Pages and Map; connections between pages, each with its source and checked by fixed rules, "Wrong", export as Mermaid, Graphviz, SVG, PNG and Obsidian links, native map on the iPhone (off by default)
- **V01.0.893** Folders at once and folder menu: the Mail page's folder list is kept sealed in the mail supply and is there at once after a restart; the "⋯" at a folder is a small menu beside it like Apple Mail (right click, a sheet on a phone), renaming and new folders right in the row; iPhone with symbols
- **V01.0.892** reMarkable documents well formatted: lists, numbers, tables, smaller head, device format
- **V01.0.891** Up to date: a stand always names its day („as of yesterday 18:00“), the weather takes „today“ from the clock instead of a forecast of yesterday, the morning briefing names mails with their day and only unread ones, the web search looks within a period with a date per hit for questions about today, and a fixed sentence of the panel says what is not current; an opened mail counts as read

1. You speak into your phone, browser, one of the apps, the terminal client, a speaker or the phone. The panel signs you in, sends the audio to **speech recognition** and gets text back.
2. The **router** picks by fixed rules which tools the question needs. The panel passes the text, with memory, conversation history, your own knowledge and exactly those tools, to the **language model** behind the LLM-Tor (or to qwen38 if you keep it).
3. When the answer needs calendars, mail, weather, Home Assistant, web search, Kiwix or Wikipedia, the panel fetches the data itself; switching and adding entries only happen after you confirm. Pictures are painted and edited by FLUX.2 klein on the Spark; music is made by ACE-Step 1.5 (at first only “Test music” for the admin under State → Checks).
4. The answer goes sentence by sentence to **text to speech** and is played as a stream while the model is still writing. Priority makes sure spoken answers and important people go first.
5. With the **Spark split** the panel, profiles, chats and calls live on the small computer and reach the models only through the TLS-Tor. If the DGX restarts or is switched off, chats, reminders and calls keep running, and emergency mode understands a few fixed commands without a language model.
6. Other apps use ASR and TTS directly through the OpenAI-style APIs with an API key, MCP programs use the Spark as an MCP server with their own access.

Every new feature is off by default. Once the admin releases it, it applies to every profile at once; only the admin can block single profiles. Guests get questions and answers only, never a tool. Updates only go live after a green self-test and can be rolled back.
